VoteTrack-AWS is a **serverless election vote tracking system** designed to collect, process, and display real-time voting results across multiple polling stations. Built with AWS services, this project ensures **scalability, reliability, and security** while automating the entire election data pipeline.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Serverless Architecture** â€“ Fully managed AWS solution using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB                
-  **Real-Time Vote Streaming** â€“ Uses **Amazon Kinesis** for fast vote processing  
- **Secure Authentication** â€“ AWS Cognito for agent login & data submission security  
- **Event-Driven Processing** â€“ SQS & Step Functions for handling vote submissions  
- **Data Analytics & Reporting** â€“ Amazon Athena & OpenSearch for vote analysis  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** â€“ Automated deployments using GitHub Actions & AWS CodePipeline  
- **Notifications** â€“ SNS for winner declaration alerts via email & SMS  
- **Web Dashboard** â€“ Static frontend hosted on S3 with CloudFront for global access
